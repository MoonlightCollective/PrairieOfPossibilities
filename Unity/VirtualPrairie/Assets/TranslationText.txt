A form of magic it is, 
When the day ends and night begins, 
Tonight, 
Feel the cool breeze whisper by
Caressing your weathered skin.

Let the bright, frosted stars,
Guide your journey beyond,
Let yourself exist within this ripple of stillness
This oasis within the fabric of the world

The Prairie is a place of healing
Should your heart be weary or torn
It has unfolded here before you, 
For you are Star-born 

Within this moonlit space, 
Express the tones of your inner mind.
Let your voice carve a brilliant path, 
With other stories it entwines.

In lumine lunari es renascentis
In moonlight you are reborn 

In this twilight hour,
Your naked path is yet unwalked,
Eternity stretches out before you,
A luminous field of waking dreams

What human heart has not known sadness
Has not endured loss or strife
But from the ashes of your sorrows
Rises a phoenix given new life

For hope is a luminous melody
That radiates across the land
It is the night breeze all around you 
- Pooling starlight in your hand

Each sorrow has its purpose,
Though it's cosmic reason oft unguessed,
But as sure as the moon brings forth twilight,
Trust that whatever is - is best.

In lumine lunari es renascentis
In moonlight you are reborn 

Tales shared with the Prairie are eternal
Across millennia and territories.
Power flows from every telling,
Kingdoms are built on stories.

Let yourself become the music
Merge with every note, rhythm and beat
Your invigorated body is song given form 
Your breath a melodic rise, fall and leap

Celestial energy colliding in this place,
Revealing this ancient, hidden space
This Prairie so few mortals ever see
Yawning open before you
with gratitude and curiosity
Tread the Prairie’s time-worn paths,
You that are Starborn.
And through thy telling become eternal
In moonlight you are reborn.

Pererrant veteres semitas agri
Tu qui natus es stella 
Et per tuam fabulam, aeterna fias
In lumine lunari es renascentis





Portals stand as sentries between realms,
Inviting you through ancient arches.
Brave wanderer, come forth!
Venture forth into the Prairie of Possibility!

Let your breath find your body,
As the velvet night settles,
Into a soft blanket of stardust,
Enveloping you in an ocean of serenity.

In this midnight moment, 
You surrender from the world you’ve known, 
To one that has been waiting, hidden 
Deep within your breastbone.

Pass beneath these portals, 
For the odyssey of a century
A realm that dwells between realms
A celestial twinkle of revery

In lumine lunari es renascentis
In moonlight you are reborn 
The pale ghosts of old sorrows
Standing vigil in your mind
Await your gracious permission
For bless-ed release most kind.

Before you lies a place
Where you can share your strife
Find connection in the act of sharing
Humanity united in this life 

Use Prairie chambers to unburden
Weight that lays upon your heart
In so doing find a lightness 
And honour your soul’s true art

In lumine lunari es renascentis
In moonlight you are reborn 

A pulsing heartbeat draws you closer,
To the creative act of the divine.
Tell your tale as a composer,
And light-up your heartline.

Whispered stories ripple from parted lips
Shared in the tranquil darkness

Tip your head back and drink in the night sky
Release yourself to the pulse of human melody 

Dance and writhe in this ancient space
A sensuous pleasure for you to embrace
 
The radiant glow of the night’s moon, 
Lighting your eyes like liquid gold,
Gently calls you through the portal,
The Prairie’s beauty, yours to behold.

In moonlight you are reborn 



You were born in clouds and dust, 
And grew reaching toward the sky.
Your soul’s gravity pulls you onward,
A grand cosmic quest on which you fly.

Meandering paths,
Circle back on themselves.
You are in no hurry to get anywhere 
But the place you will ultimately be.
- you’re free!
 
At the end of the Prairie path,
Where the silver moon has risen,
The field before you shimmering,
your soul’s truth to awaken

The worthy soul is often tested 
Sometimes by the heart's unrest,
And to grow often means to struggle --
But all is well, you are moon-blessed.

In lumine lunari es renascentis
In moonlight you are reborn 

Shine soothing starlight on your woes
- your anger fear and doubt -
Share your unique story with the Prairie
find eternal healing inside and out

With every new season’s cycle
Every revolution of this earthly orb
Hope springs eternal
And time’s wisdom your gift to absorb

Though dark is the hour,
Clear be your sight.
Bask in the glow of stories,
Enjoyed by pale moonlight.

Wander about the Prairie, 
Through its timeworn paths.
Drink in the dazzling splendor,
the rich nectar of shared tellings.  

In lumine lunari es renascentis
In moonlight you are reborn 

Your body is a vessel 
Holding the stories of your life
Pour-out its glimmering contents 
In their sharing ease your strife

In the silence of the twilight,
The Prairie yawned into being 
A glowing field of waking dreams
A windswept meadow of serenity

In lumine lunari es renascentis
In moonlight you are reborn 





In crossing the portal threshold, 
become your tomorrow, 
Celebrate that yesterday,
Was somebody else.

Glittering eyes
Know the freedom
Know the joy
Of the Prairie’s medium

If you dare, take part in this ritual,
This glorious act of creation.
Share your telling with humanity,
And achieve your own salvation.

Your silver head bathed in moonlight, 
Reveals a crown from a realm beyond,
Enjoy the wonders of the Prairie!
Until bittersweet morning doth dawn.

In lumine lunari es renascentis
In moonlight you are reborn 

Fear and triumph, 
Sorrow and joy,
All just sides of the same gold coin.

Question and answer,
Sea and sky,
Balanced contrast of the divine on high.

Light and dark,
Life and death, 
All existence poised on baited breath. 

Loosen your mind,
Let the spirit soar,
This sacred space is yours to explore. 

Every dawn is a nexus, 
Every twilight a beckoning; 
And with hope in your heart,
embrace the future’s bright reckoning

The field beyond is a gallery of tellings, 
painted in every hue of the heart,
Stories echo like memories of dreams,
Long after you return to stardust.

A veil of crystal dew drops,
draped across the obsidian sky,
Illuminates the journey onward,
Towards the Prairie’s peaceful eye.
