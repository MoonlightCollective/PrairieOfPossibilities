# Praire of possibility

## LX Studio (archived)
This is our archived animation engine and development environment for the Praire of Possibility. It is an open-source application that runs in [Processing](https://processing.org/) using the [P3LX](https://github.com/heronarts/P3LX) framework.

To get started, grab the latest version of Processing 3 at:  https://processing.org/download/

Then, simply clone or download the repo and open the project in Processing. 

The LX API reference is available at: [http://lx.studio/api/](http://lx.studio/api/)

We used this for our mercer island show.   We have since moved to a custom built unity game engine.

## Unity Game Engine
Our unity builds use a git submodule for media files.   Quick cheat sheet:
- git submodule init
- git submodule update
  - note: make sure you have setup SSH for github [helpful docs here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh)
- all set !  These files live under Unity\VirtualPrairie\Assets\Audio\FModBanks and are mastered out of this [repo here](https://github.com/MoonlightCollective/MediaFiles)
